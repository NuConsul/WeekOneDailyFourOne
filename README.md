                secondActIntent.putExtra("first_name", firstNameStringValue);
                .....
                //start the activity with the secondActIntent
           
               //IN SECOND ACTIVITY
               Intent intentFromMain = getIntent()
               String firstNameFromMain = intent.getStringExtra( "first_name");
